# pyzfile

pyzfile (pronounced pie-zee-file) is a Python package for performing I/O on native MVS record oriented data sets. All access methods are supported
including QSAM, BSAM, VSAM (KSDS, ESDS, RRDS) and hiperspaces. This library is a wrapper over the z/OS C/C++ runtime library STDIO functions such as 
`fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `flocate` etc. Refer to the IBM z/OS C/C++ runtime library documentation for details.
